## Exercise

Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Richard Isaacson consider exercise the most effective way to protect against cognitive decline.[1][2][3]

💪 **Even a little bit helps**: walking 3-5k steps per day is associated with slower cognitive decline[4]; according to Dr. Peter Attia going from zero exercise to 90 minutes per week of physical activity is associated with a 14% reduction in all-cause mortality[5] and going from zero to 180 minutes of *optimal* exercise is associated with an almost 50% reduction[6]  
💪 **More is better**: in general, higher levels of regular exercise are associated with better cognitive outcomes[7]; a large study suggests that grip strength (excellent proxy for overall strength) was strongly and inversely associated with incidence of dementia and there there is no upper limit to relationship (greater someone’s grip strength, the lower their risk of dementia)[2][8]; a large study suggests that cardiorespiratory fitness is inversely associated with long-term mortality with no observed upper limit of benefit[9]  
💪 **Mix zone 2, HIIT/VO2 max, strength training**: a meta analysis performed by Dr. Peter Attia suggests that the most effective types of exercise for delaying/preventing cognitive decline are aerobic, resistance, and mind-body or “multi-component” exercises[6]

## Health Markers

The below vascular and nutritional markers can be measured using common blood tests.

### Vascular

Dr. Peter Attia considers lipid management (see LDL cholesterol below) and not having type 2 diabetes (see fasting glucose below) to be the second and third most effective way to protect against cognitive decline.[1] Vascular risk factors (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes) can fast-forward AD and dementia pathologies.[2]

🩸 **Blood pressure:** 120/70[2]  
🩸 **LDL cholesterol:** below 50; positive effects start below 70[2]  
🩸 **Fasting glucose:** below 95[2]

See [Appendix > Health Marker Management Strategies](#health-marker-management-strategies) for additional information.

### Nutritional

🩸 **Homocysteine:** below 9 µmol/L[1]  
🩸 **Vitamin D:** 40-60 ng/mL with 50 ng/mL potentially being ideal[1][2]  
🩸 **Omega-3 Index (a blood test of EPA+DHA as % of total fatty acids):** 8-12%[3]

## Sleep

Dr. Peter Attia considers adequate sleep to be the fourth most effective way to protect against cognitive decline.[1]

💤 **7.5-8.5 hours of undisturbed sleep:** Dr. Richard Isaacson recommends 7.5-8 hours of sleep per night[2]; Dr. Peter Attia recommends 7.5-8.5 hours per night[3]  
💤 **Adequate deep and REM sleep:** Dr. Richard Isaacson recommends 1.5 hours of both deep/slow-wave and REM sleep[2]

Both can be measured reasonably accurately with a sleep tracking device, such as an Apple Watch. Self-reported sleep volume is often meaningfully higher than actual volume.[2]

Why:

* Studies suggest a 160% increase in dementia risk for people who get <5 hours of sleep vs people getting >7 hours[4]  
* Studies suggest a 60% increase in dementia risk for people with disturbed sleep vs undisturbed sleep[4]  
* Studies suggest adults in mid-life who consistently sleep fewer than 6 hours per night have a 50% increased likelihood in developing Alzheimer’s[5]

Other things to note:

* Successfully treating sleep disturbance may delay the age of onset into MCI by about 11 years and may improve cognitive function in patients already diagnosed with Alzheimer’s[3]  
* Research points to the forties and sixties as the decades of life when deep sleep is especially important for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. People who have slept less during those decades seem to be at higher risk of developing dementia later on[3]

## Smoking

🔴 **Do not smoke** 

Why:

* Smoking is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline[1][2][3]

## Alcohol

🔴 **Limit alcohol**

Why:

* Chronic drinking has strong associations with dementia[1][2][3]  
* Small study showed patients at higher risk for AD (ApoE4 carriers) who never drank were 2.3x and 3.6x less likely to develop dementia relative to high-risk patients that drank infrequently and frequently[4]  
* Dr. Peter Attia states that the role of alcohol in AD is controversial, but recommends patients not drink[5]; if abstinence is not possible, Dr. Attia recommends a maximum of 7-8 drinks per week with no more than 2 drinks in a given day[4]  
* Dr. Richard Isaacson recommends patients with one or two copies of ApoE4 not drink; if abstinence is not possible, Dr. Isaacson recommends 1-2 drinks per week max[6]

## Nutrition

Finding an optimal nutrition program requires blood tests and the use of a CGM (continuous glucose monitor).

### Principles

🧩 **Minimize fasting glucose:** nutrition program should minimize *fasting* glucose levels to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes[1], which develops when the body can no longer control blood sugar effectively and leads to chronically high glucose (measurable with fasting glucose test); patients with type 2 diabetes may have a 58% increase in risk for dementia[2]; patients with both type 2 diabetes and ApoE4 may have a ~5.5x increase in risk of developing AD[1]  
🧩 **Minimize glucose spikes:** nutrition program should minimize glucose *spikes* (temporarily high glucose levels), as measured by a CGM; repeated glucose spikes are associated with inflammation that accelerates amyloid production and deposition[3] and are linked with cognitive decline[4][5]; Dr. Peter Attia tries to avoid spikes above 130mg/dL[6]; Dr. Attia tries to keep average glucose at or below 100mg/dL with a standard deviation of less than 15mg/DL[7]; ApoE4 carriers are particularly prone to glucose spikes[7]  
🧩 **Maintain energy balance:** nutrition program should achieve an energy balance (calories consumed = calories expended)[1]; higher caloric intake is associated with increased AD risk[8]  
🧩 **Personalize:** Dr. Richard Isaacson personalizes nutrition programs based on cholesterol, Omega-3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fats, trans fats, vitamin D, B12, metabolic biomarkers (e.g. glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin), and homocysteine levels found in blood as well as body mass index[3][9; 22:00][10]  
🧩 **Avoid harm first:** Dr. Peter Attia believes bad nutrition can hurt us more than good nutrition can help[7]

### Food

There have been no long-term human studies conducted to determine effective nutrition patterns for preventing cognitive decline. The below food and dose recommendations are largely based on observational data and clinical experience rather than rigorous clinical trials.

🔴 **Limit added sugar:** Dr. Richard Isaacson guides patients to <10-20g of added sugar per day[3]; higher sugar intake is associated with worse cognitive outcomes[11]; study found that AD incidence was twice as high in Africans living in the United States compared to those in Nigeria (despite high ApoE4 prevalence), where sugar consumption is one-quarter that of Americans[12]
🔴 **Avoid highly refined carbohydrates:** Dr. Peter Attia recommends patients cut out highly-refined carbohydrates[13]; rule of thumb: if it's made from white flour or added sugar, it's a highly-refined carbohydrate  
🔴 **Avoid ultra-processed foods (especially those with trans fats):** Dr. Richard Isaacson recommends avoiding ultra-processed foods[9; 26:50][3]; rule of thumb: an ultra-processed food is a food you couldn’t make in your kitchen, if you tried[9]; trans fats are among the most brain unhealthy foods that we know of[3]; rule of thumb: if the ingredient list includes “partially hydrogenated oils”, the product contains trans fats 

🟢 **Eat dark leafy green vegetables:** Dr. Richard Isaacson believes these vegetables are the most important part of a brain-healthy diet [9; 25:10] and they delay cognitive decline[3]; 6 or more servings per week[10]; examples of DLGVs include: kale, spinach, collard greens, swiss chard, etc   
🟢 **Eat fatty fish (polyunsaturated fats):** Dr. Richard Isaacson believes fatty fish, particularly for ApoE4 carriers, eaten a couple of times per week is equally as or more important (vs dark leafy vegetables) [9; 25:20]; examples of fatty fish include: wild-caught salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, herring, albacore tuna, etc  
🟢 **Consume extra virgin olive oil (monounsaturated fats):** Dr. Richard Isaacson believes EVOO is one of the most powerful things people can do to optimize brain health[9; 12:00][3]; 2-3 tablespoons per day[14]  
🟢 **Eat blueberries and strawberries:** study suggests consuming >0.5 cup of blueberries or strawberries 2-3x per week can delay cognitive decline by >2.5 years[15]  
🟢 **Eat plant-based fats (e.g. avocado, seeds, hazelnuts, almonds):** Dr. Richard Isaacson believes that nuts are great for brain health[3]; 2 tablespoons of nuts per day[14] and/or 5 or more servings of plant-based fats per week[10]  
🟢 **Eat lean, grass-fed, unprocessed protein:** Dr. Richard Isaacson recommends consuming lean, unprocessed protein [9; 25:20][3]

The most common patterns associated with brain health are Ketogenic, Mediterranean, and MIND (alpha-sorted). See [Appendix > Nutrition Patterns](#nutrition-patterns) for information.

## Vitamins and Supplements

The most optimal way to achieve recommended levels is by eating whole foods. Supplementation is only advised when dietary intake is insufficient.

Among the vitamin/supplement brands, Momentous, Thorne, Pure Encapsulations, Nordic Naturals, Jarrow Formulas, and Carlson seem to be widely regarded as having some of the highest quality and sourcing standards.

### Vitamins

💊 **B Vitamins (B12, B9/Folate, B6)**

Why:

* There is a clear relationship between homocysteine, which is regulated by B12, B9, and B6, and brain health[1]  
* Studies in older adults with mild cognitive impairment suggest that high-dose B-vitamin supplementation (folic acid, B12, B6) may slow brain atrophy (particularly in individuals with higher baseline omega-3 fatty acid levels)[2][3][4]  
* Study showed that folic acid supplementation in older adults may improve memory and processing-speed performance compared with placebo[5]  
* A 2-year lifestyle and nutritional program, which included improving folate and B12 status, was associated with slower cognitive decline in older adults at risk for dementia[6]

Caveats: 

* Analysis suggests there is no evidence that B vitamin supplementation improves cognition in younger, cognitively healthy adults[7]  
* It's not clear homocysteine is causal so "improving it" may not do anything[1]

How to use:

* Most important B vitamins are: vitamin B12, B9/folate, and B6[5][8]  
* Dr. Richard Isaacson recommends patients in his practice take B vitamins if their B-12 levels are low or their homocysteine levels are high[9]  
* Dr. Peter Attia targets homocysteine levels below 9 in his practice[1]  
* Many well-known trials use a ~1:1:40 ratio (B12:B9:B6)[2][10][11]:  
  * Vitamin B12: 400–500 µg/day  
  * Folic acid: 400–800 µg/day  
  * Vitamin B6: 20–25 mg/day

💊 **Vitamin D**

Why:

* Risk of dementia and AD is higher with low levels of Vitamin D[1][2][3]  
* Vitamin D levels are correlated with health and cognitive outcomes (higher levels, better outcomes)[4]

Caveat: Strength of association with vitamin D and AD might be because fit people are outside exercising (increasing their vitamin D levels) and, because of that exercise, are at a lower risk[4]

How to use:

* Dr. Peter Attia targets 40-60 ng/mL for his patients[4]  
* Dr. Richard Isaacson believes levels below 30 ng/mL are problematic and that the optimal level is approximately 50 ng/mL[5]  
* Consume with fat to help maximize absorption[5]

### Supplements

💊 **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (DHA and EPA)**

Why:

* “Most brain healthy supplement” - Dr. Richard Isaacson[1]  
* Some evidence that supplementation with Omega-3s may help maintain brain health[2]  
* Both Dr. Isaacson and Dr. Peter Attia believe ApoE4 carriers benefit from higher levels of Omega-3s[1][3]  
* Studies show mice with a diet rich in DHA have 40% reduction in plaque buildup[4]; human data is less clear, but studies are flawed[3]  
* EPA/DHA supplementation seems to reduce inflammation[3][5]

How to use: 

* Dose:  
  * Dr. Isaacson recommends at least 900-1,000mg of DHA and 500-600mg of EPA to his patients (numbers are adjusted up based on blood markers; there are Omega-3 Fatty Acid tests available)[1]  
  * Dr. Attia takes 3 2,000mg Carlson pills per day[6]  
* Higher doses of EPA and DHA (5-10 grams) may increase risk of atrial fibrillation (ideal range for Omega-3 levels in blood is 10-12%)[5]

💊 **Theracurmin/Curcumin**

Why:

* Dr. Peter Attia recommends this to his patients with higher risk for neurodegenerative disease[1]  
* Study showed that it may delay amyloid accumulation in the brain of people at risk for AD[2]

## Exercise Details

There have been no long-term randomized controlled human trials that definitively establish a specific exercise program for preventing cognitive decline. Most large-scale exercise studies focus on reductions in all-cause mortality. However, this evidence is still indirectly and mechanistically relevant to dementia risk, because the strongest drivers of mortality reduction (improved cardiovascular fitness, metabolic health, and vascular function) are also key determinants of brain health and dementia risk.

The “how much is enough?” suggestions below are from Dr. Peter Attia’s “recommend” protocol as well as his “I only have 3 hours per week for exercise” protocol. The idea behind the “3 hours paper week” protocol is that, according to Dr. Attia, the clinical research suggests that going from a hundred percent inactivity to just three well thought out hours a week of exercise can result in an almost a 50% reduction in mortality.[1]

### Aerobic Efficiency (Zone 2) Training

What is it? Cardio where the effort is low enough that you can still maintain a conversation, but fast enough that the conversation might be a little strained. At the top of zone 2, you should be able to talk, but should not be particularly interested in holding a conversation. If you can’t speak in complete sentences, you're likely into zone 3. If you can comfortably converse, you’re likely in zone 1[2]

Why: 

* Zone 2 training stimulates the creation of many new and more efficient mitochondria and eliminates mitochondria that has become dysfunctional. Healthy mitochondria are important for maintaining the health of our brain and for controlling potential bad actors like oxidative stress and inflammation[3][4]  
* Zone 2 training also improves VO2 max[3] (see next section)

How much is enough? According to Dr. Peter Attia, 3 hours per week is the minimum required for most people to derive a benefit and make improvements[2]; if you only have 3 hours per week to dedicate to exercise, Dr. Attia recommends spending 1 hour on zone 2 training[1]

### Maximum Aerobic Output (VO2 Max or High-Intensity Interval) Training

What is it? V02 max (the maximum rate at which a person can utilize oxygen; the more oxygen your body is able to use, the higher your VO2) efforts are hard, minutes-long efforts. Intervals range from 3-8 minutes and can be done on a stationary bike, rowing machine, treadmill/track, etc. The formula is to go for 4 minutes at the maximum pace you can sustain for this amount of time then ride or jog for 4 minutes at an easy pace to recover (let heart rate come back down to below 100). Repeat this 4-6 times to complete a session[2]

Why:

* A large study suggests that cardiorespiratory fitness is inversely associated with long-term mortality with no observed upper limit of benefit[5]

How much is enough? According to Dr. Peter Attia, 1-2 sessions per week[2]; if you only have 3 hours per week to dedicate to exercise, Dr. Attia recommends 1 hour of something high intensity with coordinated movement (e.g. shadowboxing, active dance class, etc.)[1]

### Strength Training

What is it? Dr. Peter Attia structures strength training on[2]: 

* Grip strength (how hard you can grip with your hands); lifts include: dead hang, farmer’s carry, etc  
* Concentric and eccentric loading (i.e. loading muscles when they are shortening and when they are lengthening) and pulling motions; lifts/activities include: pullups, pulldowns, deadlifts, rows, etc  
* Hip-hinging movements (bend at the hips – not the spine – to harness body’s largest muscles, the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings); lifts include: deadlifts, squats, step-ups, hip-thrusters, and single-leg variants of exercises that strengthen the legs, glutes, and lower back

Why:

* A large study suggests that grip strength (excellent proxy for overall strength) was strongly and inversely associated with incidence of dementia and there there is no upper limit to relationship (greater someone’s grip strength, the lower their risk of dementia)[6][7]

How much is enough? Dr. Peter Attia lifts heavy weights four times per week[2]; if you only have 3 hours per week to dedicate to exercise, Dr. Attia recommends 1 hour of strength training[1]

## Health Marker Management Strategies

Blood pressure:

* Primary: weight loss (if overweight), dietary sodium reduction (especially processed and restaurant foods), DASH-style or Mediterranean diet (high in fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium), regular aerobic exercise, antihypertensive medications (when indicated; ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides, calcium-channel blockers)  
* Secondary: potassium intake optimization (primarily from whole foods; supplements only when appropriate), reducing alcohol intake, reducing stress (chronic sympathetic activation raises BP), treating sleep apnea (if present), improved sleep duration and quality, reducing NSAID use (where possible)

LDL cholesterol:

* Primary: dietary saturated fat reduction (replace with unsaturated fats: olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish), weight loss (if overweight), Statins (when indicated; strongest LDL-lowering and outcome data), increased soluble fiber (e.g. oats, psyllium, legumes), reduced dietary cholesterol (modest effect, but additive in "hyper-responders" such as individuals with ApoE4, insulin resistance, low-fiber or high-saturated fat diet, etc)  
* Secondary: Ezetimibe (if statins insufficient or not tolerated), PCSK9 inhibitors (for very high-risk cases or if statins insufficient), plant sterols/stanols (clinically meaningful doses usually come from fortified foods and supplements), replacing refined carbs with whole foods (indirect LDL benefit), consistent aerobic exercise (modest LDL effect; stronger for triglycerides and HDL)

Fasting glucose: 

* Primary: weight loss (if overweight), dietary carbohydrate reduction (especially refined carbs such as sugary drinks, pastries, etc), regular aerobic + resistance exercise, improved sleep duration and quality, Metformin (when indicated)  
* Secondary: time restricted eating, increased fiber intake, reduced alcohol intake

Homocysteine: 

* Adequate vitamin B (B12, folate, B6) status (see [Vitamins and Supplements > Vitamins](#vitamins) section), treat underlying causes, address medications that raise homocysteine

Vitamin D:

* Sunlight exposure (regular, non-burning UVB exposure when seasonally and geographically feasible), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation (most reliable way to raise and maintain blood levels; see [Vitamins and Supplements > Vitamins](#vitamins) section), weight management (vitamin D is sequestered in adipose tissue; obesity lowers bioavailability), adequate dietary fat intake (vitamin D is fat-soluble; improves absorption)

Omega-3 Index:

* Regular consumption of fatty fish (e.g. salmon, sardines, mackerel, anchovies; typically 2–3 servings/week or more as needed), omega-3 supplementation (EPA+DHA) when dietary intake is insufficient to reach target blood levels (see [Vitamins and Supplements > Supplements](#supplements) section)

## Sleep Improvement Strategies

* Completely dark and cool room[1][3]  
* Limit blue light (in bulbs and electronic devices), which tells our brain it is daytime, 2 hours before bedtime[3]  
* Avoid anything anxiety-producing or stimulating (e.g. work emails) >1 hour before bedtime[1][3]  
* Passive activities better than active (e.g. read a book, watch TV)[3]  
* Keep bedroom cool (65F seems optimal)[3]  
* Temperature-controlled mattress[1]; may increase time spent in deep sleep and total time asleep[2]  
* Don’t drink alcohol (it’s very difficult to have a good night’s sleep if you have alcohol in the proximity of bedtime)[1][3]  
* Don’t drink coffee after noon (half-life of coffee is up to 6 hours)[3]  
* Sustained endurance exercise (zone 2) done in morning/afternoon (>3 hours before bedtime) can create sleep pressure[3]  
* +30 minute dose of strong daylight during the daytime[3]  
* Manage stress[3]  
* Don’t eat anything <3 hours before bedtime[3]  
* Eat healthily[3]  
* Spend time in a sauna (dry sauna; 198F; 15 minutes) or hot tub before bed[1][7]  
* Give yourself enough time to sleep (ideally going to bed 9 hours before you need to wake up)[3]  
* Fix wakeup time and don’t deviate from it (even on weekends)[3]  
* Pharmaceutical agents/medications[1]:  
  * Pregabalin  
  * Trazodone  
* Supplements[1]:  
  * Glycine  
  * Ashwagandha  
  * Magtein or magnesium L-threonate  
  * Melatonin (Dr. Peter Attia does not recommend frequent use)

## Nutrition Patterns

### Ketogenic

The ketogenic diet relies on very low carbohydrate intake, high fat consumption, and moderate protein intake to shift metabolism toward fat-derived ketones as the primary energy source.

Why:

* Randomized controlled trials suggest that ketogenic therapies can general cognition and memory in subjects with MCI and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease[1]

**Pattern Definition[2]**

### Mediterranean

The Mediterranean-style diet relies on more monounsaturated fats, fewer refined carbohydrates, and the regular consumption of fatty fish.

Why:

* A series of studies (PREDIMED) suggest the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts may be associated with better cognitive performance (relative to a low-fat control diet)[1] as well as slower cognitive decline and lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly in the EVOO group[2]  
* Mediterranean diet and lifestyle are associated with cognitive longevity. For example, Southern Italians who carry ApoE4 and live in Italy exhibit a normal rate of living to be in the oldest 1% of the population. However, Southern Italians who carry ApoE4, but who live in the United States exhibit a highly reduced chance of living into late old age[3]  
* Mediterranean style diet when followed by people with two copies of ApoE4 may lower risk of dementia by 35% [4; 4:00]

**Pattern Definition[5]**

| What to eat |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Eat every meal | Fruits, veggies, whole grains, extra virgin olive oil |
| Eat at least 3 servings per week | Fish/seafood, nuts, legumes |
| Limit to 1 serving a day | Poultry, low-fat dairy, eggs |
| Limit to 1 serving per week | Red meat, sweets |

### MIND

The MIND diet emphasizes leafy green vegetables, berries, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, and regular fish consumption, while limiting red meat, butter, cheese, sweets, and fried foods.

Why:

* Study suggests that patients with high adherence to MIND diet may have a relative dementia risk reduction of 50%[1]

**Pattern Definition[2]**

| What to eat |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Every day | 3 servings of whole grains, 1 serving of vegetables, 1 glass of wine (5oz) |
| Most days | Leafy green vegetables (6x), nuts (5x) |
| Every other day | Beans (3x) |
| Twice a week | Poultry, berries |
| Once a week | Fish |

| What to limit |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Less than 1 T. a day | Butter and stick margarine |
| Less than 5x/week | Pastries and sweets |
